# GeezLab Tigrinya BiLingual Lexicon

Statistically generated Tigrinya English Word Dictionary  

Finding a free Tigrinya-English dictionary for research or educational purposes is not easy, to say the least. Building a dictionary from scratch manually (the proper way) requires a lot of effort and time. As an option, presented here is a statistically generated bilingual lexicon between English and Tigrinya, using nothing but few algorithms and parallel corpora. 


No human supervision was done, so the content is highly crude and contains numerous inaccuracies, but it is could be a good start for many applications.
